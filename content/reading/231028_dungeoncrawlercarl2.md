I got behind in recording reading, so this is a catch up :)  I haven't recorded my reading for a couple months so this will be abreviated.

This is the second _Carl_ book.  It's interesting, because the first book was kind of pulp.  Fun to read, not much registered as deep.  I mean, it has a talking cat.

That said, I've read all the series up through 5 (all that's published as of today) and it has taken on a vibe that's only visibile over the longer scope.  The series has elements of _Inferno_, with the visual element of going down levels of progressively more evil.  There's also a lot of chance to think about man's isolation, how we push each other away even in those moments, and how that pulls from Dante.

Carl has also taken on a certain Batman/Dark Knight aspect, as the series processes through the nature of evil.  Yes, it's a weird setting for moral philosophy, but some of the situations are more developed versions of the trolley delimma and talk about the emotional wreckage of those decisions.

So, still fun, but it's developed into something that makes me think at a deeper level.  Pretty cool for pulp!
