In the gameshow after the end of the world, players try to survive by completing a dungeon level and descending to the next.  This series has serious overtones from _Inferno_, except that it mentions more than nine levels.  A lot of more subtle clues are present in the mechanics of the story as well, as  you read.  I look forward to the next book!
