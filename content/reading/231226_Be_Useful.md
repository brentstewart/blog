Arnold Schwarzenegger's father used to tell him to "be useful".  Schwarzenegger sets out in this book to describe how he's tried to live up to that direction.  Part autobiography, part hagiography, part self-help, this book enjoyably combines reminescence, exhortation, and encouragement.  Arnold's advice isn't unique, but it is presented in a straight-forward way and accompanies some story of an example from his own life.

I found the book to be interesting and I would recommend it.  In fact, I bought a copy for my son for Christmas.  Arnold's suggestions make sense, and his stories make them seem possible.  Arnold has been successful in several distinct areas - notably bodybuilding, acting, and politics - so there's some weight behind the words.  __Be Useful__ was an enjoyable book to read.
