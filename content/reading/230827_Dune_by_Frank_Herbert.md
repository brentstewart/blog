A friend recently asked for my opinion on _Dune_, the siminal work by Frank Herbert.  I read _Dune_ about forty years ago, but my overall impression deep and imaginative world-building, an Islamic-inspired setting (still strangely unique in Science Fiction), and the Superman-esque storytelling around the Kwsisatz-Haderach.  I was deeply taken in by the setting and characters, but put off by the _Deus ex Machina_ elements of Paul's abilities.

I have often remarked that a readers' time and experience can completely re-align a story.  For example, I've read _Stranger in a Strange Land_ and _Ender's Game_ several times, decades apart, and walked away with new insights and appreciation each time.  There's an old Buddhist saying that one cannot enter the same river twice - both the river and the person are dynamic and the second dip is a different person and different water.  Well, there's no water on Arrakis and it was the same for me both times.

This reading journal isn't intended to be a set of reviews, more a record of where I've been and some encouragement for you to try some of them.  I restrict myself to two questions:

## Did I enjoy it?
Yes and kinda.  This was my uncle Neal's favorite and I read it and some of the sequels out of my love for him.  Reading it was a nice reminder of our time together.  Yes - I knew the story, knew where it was going, have seen the films and been reminded of plot, and I still enjoyed reading it and appreciating the world Frank Herbert created.  Kinda - I felt that the plot resolved itself in an unsatisfying way.  If the spice hand't affected Paul, it might have had a more interesting conclusion.  I've read several Frank Herbert books and I enjoy his imagination and writing, but stumble over his plotting sometimes.

## Do I recommend it?
If you are a serious student of Science Fiction or even an affecianado, _Dune_ is a touchstone.  I think the religious angle could lead to some interesting thoughts and conversations.  It's interesting, for example, the the repulsion of _jihad_ is a part of Paul's thought process, even thought the book was written well before the big middle-Eastern conflicts of my lifetime.  Less committed readers may this a difficult read to enjoy.
