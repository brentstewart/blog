Book 3 continues an apocraphal but silly story of the world ending in a pangalactic game show.  As mentioned in the previous review, I've found the books to take on a more interesting tone as the series progresses.

This series was recommended by a friend, but I enjoyed it and have continued to read each installment.  The series is entertaining and easy to read.  I continue to recommend it.
