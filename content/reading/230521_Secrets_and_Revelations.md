_Secrets and Revelations_ is the fourth book in Diane Greenwood Muir's Bellingwood series.  This book finds the town festival approaching and a group of young men from inner-city Chicago visiting.  When Polly finds the body, because she _always_ finds a body, it sets the wheels turning.  Set against this Polly also hears from an old family friend and has to process that relationship.

## Did I enjoy it?
Yes.  The books are highly episodic and easy to binge.  There's a certain suspension of disbelief - I mean, how many murdres really happen in a small Iowa town?  But these are breezy and the mystery is usually about as dangerous as _Murder, She Wrote_.

## Do I recommend it?
Absolutely.  I think a surprisingly large section of people will enjoy these books.  I've mentioned before that there's a certain formula to this series, and it's kind of part of the charm.  That said, Muir does a great job of twisting that formula or playing with expectations.  She does this while continuing to advance the stories of the various background characters.
