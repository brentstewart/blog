I had been reading Polly for a while and wanted something different.  Judging a book by it's cover, I picked up _Star Dreadnought Bismark_, which is the first part of _The Void Wars_.  I love science fiction and when I read for fun, that's my go to, but I also enjoy history and - per the book description - here we have some overlap between WWII and science ficiton.

_Bismark_ is a retelling of the story of the German battleship, famously recounted by Johnny Horton.  You're humming now, aren't you?  Well, Horton did it better.  This book sets the battle in a future setting, changes remarkably few details, and plows ahead.  The names of ships and people are maintained, the basic gist of the plot is the same.

## Did I enjoy it?
It really isn't a bad idea, but Michael Thomas doesn't waste very little time on character development or exposition and I never really came to keep people straight or care about what happened.

## Do I recommend it?
No.  I got the book as a bundle of all three _Void War_ stories and I don't think I'll read the other two.  There was a little interest in seeing how he'd relate the story and the vague idea that there would be some event to subvert the telegraphed plot, but it never came.  If you like WWII, I recommend John Keegan.
