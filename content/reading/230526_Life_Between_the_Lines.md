This is the fifth book in the Bellingwood series.  _Life Between the Lines_ continues Diane Greenwood Muir's stories in the ficitonal Iowa town with Polly.  One of the conventions of the series is that Polly finds a dead body and gets swept up in the investigation at some point.  This time it's an author staying in her hostel.  The balancing convention is the stories of small town relationships, which conitnue to develop in this book.
