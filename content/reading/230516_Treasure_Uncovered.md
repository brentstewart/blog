 I read through the first ten or so of these books, one after another.  This review is about book three.
 
 Here the mystery is about the death of one of the employees of the Sycamore Inn.   The cozy set of friends that Polly has developed in Iowa grows to embrace an old friend from Boston, and Polly and Henry continue to see each other.  

 These core elements, stories of rural relationships, independence and co-dependence, with a dash of whodunit thrown in.  The books are a lot of fun, as my chain-reading testifies to.

## Did I enjoy it?
 Yes.  Diane Greenwood Muir continues to demonstrate a good mix of plot elements, weaving together the different stories that each have their own types of stress.  Muir is also capable at handling such a large ensemble of characters - at times it feels like the whole town shows up as a character!

 ## Do I recommend it?
 Yes.  These are great fun and can't be beat as a summer book.  We are testing them on my daughter now and she's binging like my wife and I did.  So my step mother, wife, and daughter, three very different people have all enjoyed these as much as I have.  I think the boys would enjoy them too, but the lack of dragons and lasers on the cover does make it a hard sell.
