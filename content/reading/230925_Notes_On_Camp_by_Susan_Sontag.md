I think I came upon this essay after a discussion about the _Barbie_ movie.  Haven't seen the movie, but apparently it fits into a theatrical style called _camp_.  I know camp when I see it, but had trouble defining it or what the point of it was.

Having read _Notes on Camp_, I think Sontag also has trouble defining camp.  She defines camp as a style that enjoys exageration, focuses on appearances, and denies concepts of rightness - indeed reviles in uniqueness.

Sontags approach is scattered, broad, and refuses to be hemmed in by a structured argument.  It's like a watercolor, notes blending into each other, with the resulting scene muddied as if seen through gauze.  Maybe that's the point - that the harder you examine something the less it becomes camp, like some kind of quantum uncertainty of style.

For all it's blotchy presentation, I learned something about the style.  I think I also gained some insight into the progression of America sense the 1960s, when this was written.  In many ways we have become a people of uncertain principles, focused on style, and valueing uniqueness above all else.  I'm not sure that was her point, but there's some accuracy and tragedy in that connection.

## Did I like it?
Meh.  It was thought provoking and short.  It would be a good reading for a discussion group - easy to digest, a lot to chew on, and a fertile ground for whichever way the discussion goes.

## Do I recommend it?
Not really.  I think the folks who will find value in this are interested in the cultural development of the US and folks who enjoy camp.
