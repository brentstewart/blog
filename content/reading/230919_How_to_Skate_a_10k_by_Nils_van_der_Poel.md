I enjoy reading about the various approaches that very successful people have, the adaptions they've had to make, and the lessons they've learned.  I really enjoy, for instance, the writing of Atul Gwande and often find that his lessons from surgery apply in surprising ways to my life in computers.

Nils van der Poel is the current (as of 2023) World and Olympic record holder in 5K and 10K speed skating.  After his success at the Olympics, he wrote an essay titled ["How to skate a 10K . . . and also half a 10K"](https://www.howtoskate.se/).  It's remarkable that someone who has been so successful would be so open about their approach, but that was the least surprising thing about the essary.

Van der Poel writes about an approach to finding his limits and consistently pushing past, but at the same time the importance of maintaining balance.  He was able to build and maintain friendships outside sport, enjoy being a young man, and build a healthy and mutually supportive relationship with his coach.  These other relationships let him see himself as something more than "just a skater" and hold his self-worth up outside of his success on the ice.  They also helped him be accountable to his opportunities and ability.  Van der Poel also writes about appreciating his moment and understanding the obligations that come with opportunity.

## Did I enjoy it?
Yes.  This essay has a conversational tone, but I thought it had some valuable insights.  Given his experience, it is easy to respect the source as well.

## Do I recommend it?
Anyone interested in success, not burning out, and building a life alongside success will find something in this essay.  It comes in at 64 pages, but half that is a training journal so it's a quick read.

My oldest played a sport and I sometimes reflect on the things I got right but more often got wrong in supporting and encouraging him.  As I read this essay, I thought a lot about that experience and recommend this to the father's who wrestle with teaching their sons commitment and not always understanding how to teach balance.  God bless us all, we do our best.
