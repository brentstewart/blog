Even for a series based in dark humor, book six turns up the dark aspect.  The rules of the dugneon are forcing players to turn against each other, the odds have gone from long to impossible, and Carl continues to try to find a way to hold onto an element of humanity against a tidal pull toward hatred.  I am enjoying the series.  It's heading toward some kind of major turn on level 9, which should be in the next book to come out.
