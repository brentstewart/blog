Brad Stulberg's _Master of Change_, at a high level, is about the need to build a durable yet flexible approach to life.  He breaks his book up into a discussion of mindset, identity, and actions.  

The discussion around a rugged and flexible _mindset_  reminds me of the Heraclitis saying that is somethig like, "A man never crosses the same river twice, because when he returns he's not the same man and it's not the same river."  The mindset Stulberg describes is about going with the flow, but not being swept away.

The discussion about a rugged and flexible _identity_ struck close.  In recent years my children have moved out and moved on, and my wife and I have had to rethink who we are because we're no longer (primarily) "Mom and Dad".  Everyone faces those moments when their identity is challenged and they have to consider reinvention.

Finally, Stulberg describes rugged and flexible _actions_ more in terms of acting thoughtfully.

## Did I like it?
It's not a bad book, but I doubt if I'll quote it or really dwell much on what I read.  Most of the book goes over ground that readers with a philosophical bent will have seen, although it's put together nicely and may have more of an impact on a younger reader.

Stulberg uses some engaging examples, but he touches on them quickly and spends the bulk of his time elaborating his point.  It felt like developing the stories and having more of those asides would have made the book more engaging.

## Do I recommend it?
Meh.  Worth a read if it's sitting on the coffee table at your rented beach house when you arrive and it starts raining.
