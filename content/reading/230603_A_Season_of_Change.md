I flew through the first ten of these books, hardly stopping for breath.  Number six finds three tech-bros moving to Bellingwood to open a winery, and it's there that the body is discovered.  The three California hot-shots moving back to the small town is an obvious chance to contrast values and assumptions, _a la_ Green Acres.  One thing I appreciate about Muir is that she writes interesting books and avoids the cheap and obvious.

## Did I enjoy it?
 Yes.  This continues to be an easy series to read.

 ## Do I recommend it?
 Yes.  These are easy to recommend and appeal to a lot of different people.
