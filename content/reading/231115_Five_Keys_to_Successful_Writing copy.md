One of my goals in 2024 is to spend more time writing.  This book was free on Amazon and I thought it might help me think through ways to be more effecient and get started.

## Did I enjoy it?
Eh.

## Do I recommend it?
I don't recommend this book.  It focuses more on the process of selling your work, and less on the creative process (which seems to be the marketing direction of the jacket).  I also didn't really think it had new or insightful thoughts in the sales direction.  I mostly found common sense, well worn trueisms, and some things that were oddly too specific to this author.
