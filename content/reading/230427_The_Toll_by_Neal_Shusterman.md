__The Toll_ concludes the _Arc of the Scythe_ trilogy that started with [Scythe](/230316_scythe_by_neal_shusterman) and continued in [Thunderhead](/230408_thunderhead_by_neal_shusterman/).  Those books are about a future where humanity has transcended death through regeneration, but there is still a need to prevent overpopulation.  Administering death falls to a group of people referred to as Scythes.  This is a young adult book series dealing with a very mature topic.  There are descriptions of people dying and I felt that the first book walked a line, while the second book tripped on the line and into a pornography of violence.  Science Fiction has always found a way to approach a topic from a new direction, but I'm not confident that young teenagers understand their own mortality enough to get the more high-minded theme.

The recurring death and resurrection of characters reminds me of Philip Jose Farmer's _Riverworld_ series.  I read that as a young teenager and I think some of what was being described passed unobserved in my reading.

## Did I enjoy it?
Meh.  My teenage son really enjoyed this series, but I've struggled with it at times.  Part of that is a different appreciation for death, it being much less abstract at my age.  Part of that is because I felt the plot dragged in areas.  

## Do I recommend it?

At the end of book two, I said that I needed to see how it ended before I could recommend.  Well, having read the whole series I can report that Shusterman stuck the landing and I feel better about the series.  I don't share my son's high opinion, but it was a good read.  I felt like _Scythe_ was more contemplative about death and _Thunderhead_ and _The Toll_ turned away from the concept and into storytelling.

Shusterman, I think, is aiming above the maturity of his audience.  That said, book 3 read fairly quickly and the plot developed some real propulsion in the second half.

Your mileage may vary, and I recommend discussing it with your teen if you buy it for them.  I don't think I recommend it, mostly because I feel there are better books, but tastes vary and others will enjoy this series more than I did.
