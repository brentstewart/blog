Reparation
* reasons to consider
  * repay historic sins
  * theft of labor, opportunity
* problems
  * ancestry - how much of your ancestry was a slave, or a slave holder?  Is it enough to be black or white
  * problematic idea of "blood debt"
  * already doing it through admissions and hiring policies
  * who would pay? current citizens didn't do it.
  * problems associated with unearned money, ie lottery winners
  * no amount would be enough
  * theft of labor and opportunity continues



Migration
* pay forward
* open doors to any one who can make it here and wants to be here
* allow new states
* prime directive to prevent another Hawaii
* redirect military spending to supporting immigrants here and lifting up third-world countries abroad

strengths - court system, rule of law, government that swings between socialist and capaitalist that can adjust and not be defined by one ideology
