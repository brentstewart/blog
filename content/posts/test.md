I've been writing a technical blog called [Nextpertise](https://nextpertise.net).  That been a lot of fun, but my interest extend past just technical things and I've wanted to create a space to write on a variety of subjects.  That led to the creation of this site.

I've been recording my reading at Nextpertise for a bit and I'll move all that over here.  That's been a big source of my personal musings, so this will also be a place to explore some of those ideas a bit further.

If you are following along, I hope these posts will be interesting and thought provoking.  I don't always agree with the zeitgeist, but I always try to maintain a sense of respect for other people and gratitude for all that I've been given.  If I occassionally take an antagonistic stance, for the sake of making a point, I hope that you'll understand that I bring good will and maintain a sense of humor.

God bless!

Brent
